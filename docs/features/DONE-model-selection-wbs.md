- [ ] Review UI responsiveness across devices
- [ ] Check model selection persistence
- [ ] Validate error message display
- [ ] Test browser compatibility
- [ ] Verify accessibility compliance
- [ ] Review loading states and transitions

### 4.2 Backend Bug Hunt (1 day)
- [ ] Stress test concurrent model requests
- [ ] Verify memory usage during processing
- [ ] Check database connection handling

- [x] Update deployment guide
- [x] Create troubleshooting guide

### 5.2 Deployment (0.5 day)
- [x] Run database migrations
- [x] Deploy frontend changes
- [x] Deploy backend changes
- [x] Verify monitoring setup

## Dependencies

### Frontend Dependencies
- [x] Database migration must be complete before results page updates
- [x] Model selection module must be complete before processing page updates

### Backend Dependencies
- [x] Database migration must be complete before upload endpoint updates
- [x] Upload endpoint must be updated before processing pipeline changes

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- [x] API rate limits: Implement proper error handling and user feedback
- [x] Database migration: Ensure rollback script is tested
- [x] Concurrent processing: Test with multiple file uploads

### Operational Risks
- [x] Model availability: Implement fallback to default model
- [x] Performance impact: Monitor processing times and adjust queue as needed

## Success Criteria
- [x] Users can successfully select models
- [x] Processing works reliably with both models
- [x] Results correctly show model information
- [x] Export files include model data
- [x] Error handling provides clear user feedback

## Total Estimated Time: 12 days
âœ“ Completed in estimated timeframe

Note: This timeline assumes:
- One developer working on the feature
- No major blockers or dependencies outside the project
- Available test environments for both AI models
