- [x] Add model information tooltips
- [x] Test client-side functionality

### 1.2 Processing Page Updates (1 day)
- [ ] Update processing.html to show selected model
- [ ] Modify progress tracking display
- [ ] Add model-specific status messages
- [ ] Test progress display with different models

### 1.3 Results Page Updates (1 day)
- [ ] Add model column to results table
- [ ] Update CSV/JSON export functionality
- [ ] Test results display and exports

## 2. Backend Implementation (3 days)

### 2.1 Database Updates (0.5 day)
- [ ] Create database migration script
- [ ] Add ai_provider column
- [ ] Add model_version column
- [ ] Test migration script
- [ ] Create rollback script

### 2.2 Upload Endpoint Updates (1 day)

- [ ] Test processing pipeline with both models

## 3. Testing (2 days)

### 3.1 Unit Testing (1 day)
- [ ] Test model selection functionality
- [ ] Test upload with model parameter
- [ ] Test processing pipeline
- [ ] Test database operations

### 3.2 Integration Testing (1 day)
- [ ] Test end-to-end flow with OpenAI
- [ ] Test end-to-end flow with Anthropic
- [ ] Test error scenarios
- [ ] Test concurrent processing

## 4. Documentation & Deployment (1 day)

### 4.1 Documentation Updates (0.5 day)
- [ ] Update API documentation
- [ ] Add model selection to user guide
- [ ] Update deployment guide
- [ ] Create troubleshooting guide

### 4.2 Deployment (0.5 day)
- [ ] Run database migrations
- [ ] Deploy frontend changes
- [ ] Deploy backend changes
- [ ] Verify monitoring setup

## Dependencies

### Frontend Dependencies
- Database migration must be complete before results page updates
- Model selection module must be complete before processing page updates

### Backend Dependencies
- Database migration must be complete before upload endpoint updates
- Upload endpoint must be updated before processing pipeline changes

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- API rate limits: Implement proper error handling and user feedback
- Database migration: Ensure rollback script is tested
- Concurrent processing: Test with multiple file uploads

### Operational Risks
- Model availability: Implement fallback to default model
- Performance impact: Monitor processing times and adjust queue as needed

## Success Criteria
- Users can successfully select models
- Processing works reliably with both models
- Results correctly show model information
- Export files include model data
- Error handling provides clear user feedback

## Total Estimated Time: 10 days

Note: This timeline assumes:
- One developer working on the feature
- No major blockers or dependencies outside the project
- Available test environments for both AI models
