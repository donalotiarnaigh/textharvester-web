## Issue #1: Empty Record Sheet Handling
**Status:** Resolved  
**Date Reported:** 2024-03-22  
**Component:** MemorialOCRPrompt  
**Severity:** High  

### Description
When uploading an empty record sheet, the system fails to handle null values properly, resulting in an unhandled error.

### Error Message
```
[ERROR] Error processing file uploads/page_5_1747903505321.jpg: Error: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'trim')
    at MemorialOCRPrompt.validateAndConvert (/Users/danieltierney/projects/textharvester-web/src/utils/prompts/templates/MemorialOCRPrompt.js:150:15)
    at processFile (/Users/danieltierney/projects/textharvester-web/src/utils/fileProcessing.js:40:42)
    at process.processTicksAndRejections (node:internal/process/task_queues:105:5)
```

### Analysis
The error occurs in the `validateAndConvert` method of `MemorialOCRPrompt` class when attempting to trim a null value. Upon code review, the issue was found on line 150 where `field.transform(value)` is called without checking if the value is null. The transform function for text fields attempts to call `.trim()` on the null value, causing the error.

Specifically:
1. In `src/utils/prompts/templates/MemorialOCRPrompt.js`, the `validateAndConvert` method handles null checks for the 'year_of_death' field case but not for other fields
2. In `src/utils/prompts/types/memorialFields.js`, the transform functions for string fields (e.g., `value.trim()`) assume non-null values
3. The error happens when processing data from an empty record sheet where the AI model returns null values for required fields
4. There's no early validation to reject completely empty sheets before attempting to transform the data

### Solution Implemented
1. Added `ProcessingError` class extending standard Error with type information
2. Implemented helper functions `isEmptySheetError` and `isValidationError`
3. Enhanced `MemorialOCRPrompt` to use these typed errors with descriptive messages
4. Modified `fileProcessing.js` to handle empty sheet errors gracefully by returning error objects
5. Updated `fileQueue.js` to store both successful and error results, continuing processing when empty sheets are encountered
6. Added UI components to display error messages to users

## Issue #2: Progress Bar Malfunction
**Status:** Partially Resolved  
**Date Reported:** 2024-03-22  
**Component:** UI/Progress Tracking  
**Severity:** Medium  

### Description
When uploading multiple image files (3 in the test case), the progress bar exhibits incorrect behavior:
1. Starts at 0%
2. Almost immediately jumps to 200%
3. Gets stuck at 200%
4. No automatic redirect to results page occurs
5. Results are processed correctly but require manual navigation to view

**Update (2025-05-23):** Additional testing reveals:
- When uploading 3 populated images, the progress bar goes up to 200% before redirecting
- When uploading 3 images with one empty, the progress bar goes up to 300% and doesn't redirect automatically

### Expected Behavior
1. Progress bar should start at 0%
2. Should increment proportionally based on processing progress
3. Should reach 100% when all files are processed
4. Should automatically redirect to results page upon completion

### Analysis
The issue appears to be related to:
1. Progress calculation logic not properly handling multiple files
2. Progress event handling possibly double-counting events
3. Completion detection not triggering redirect
4. Disconnect between actual processing status and UI representation
5. Different behavior when empty images are included in the batch

### Partial Resolution
Progress tracking has been improved but not fully fixed. Implementation of error handling has resolved some aspects of this issue, but the progress calculation still doesn't increment proportionally with multiple files.

## Issue #3: Missing First Name Validation Error
**Status:** Resolved  
**Date Reported:** 2024-03-22  
**Component:** MemorialOCRPrompt  
**Severity:** High  

### Description
When processing a PDF with a record containing no first name (e.g., "R.R Talbot Junr"), the system fails with a validation error. The error occurs even though another valid record ("Rev. Peter Butler") exists on the same page.

**Update (2024-03-22):** Different behavior observed with Anthropic provider:
- Anthropic ignores the initials "R.R"
- Takes "Talbot" as first name and "Jun" as last name
- No validation error occurs, but results in incorrect name parsing
- Shows inconsistency in name handling between providers

**Update (2025-05-22):** While validation rules haven't been updated, error handling now works correctly:
- System properly identifies and reports the validation error
- Processing continues for other valid records
- Error information is included in the progress tracking
- Results page shows valid records while indicating errors

**Update (2025-05-23):** Scope clarification:
- Provider-specific name extraction rules are NOT required for this issue
- Extracting multiple identities per page is NOT needed - additional names are expected to be in the inscription field
- Focus should be on name parsing standardization and fixing the "undefined attempts" bug

**Update (2025-05-24):** Issue Resolved:
- Implemented standardized name parser in `standardNameParser.js`
- Added comprehensive test suite in `standardNameParser.test.js`
- Integrated with `MemorialOCRPrompt.js`
- Added support for:
  - Common name detection to prevent incorrect initial formatting
  - Provider-specific initial handling
  - Improved inscription name extraction
  - Standardized name component handling
- All test cases passing including:
  - Standard name processing
  - Full name field handling
  - Common name formatting edge cases
  - Name extraction from inscriptions
  - Provider-specific options
  - Missing field handling
  - Data structure preservation

**Update (2025-05-25):** "Undefined attempts" bug fixed:
- Added tests to verify error message handling
- Confirmed validation errors are properly categorized and displayed
- No more references to undefined "attempts" variable in error messages
- Error handling properly distinguishes between validation and processing errors
- All test cases passing, including:
  - Missing first name (now optional)
  - Invalid first name format
  - Empty string first name
  - Special characters in first name
  - Mixed error types display

### Error Message
```
[ERROR] Error processing file uploads/test_17479_1747903798021_page-5.jpg: Error: Invalid name format for first_name
    at MemorialOCRPrompt.validateAndConvert (/Users/danieltierney/projects/textharvester-web/src/utils/prompts/templates/MemorialOCRPrompt.js:150:15)
    at processFile (/Users/danieltierney/projects/textharvester-web/src/utils/fileProcessing.js:40:42)
    at process.processTicksAndRejections (node:internal/process/task_queues:105:5)
```

### Root Cause Analysis
After extensive investigation, I've identified several specific issues in the name validation logic:

1. **Rigid Name Format Expectations**:
   - The current validation assumes all memorial inscriptions follow a standard "First Last" pattern
   - No accommodation for names with initials only (e.g., "R.R. Talbot")
   - No handling for missing first names or single-name entries
   - No support for compound names with hyphens or multiple words

2. **Provider-Specific Parsing Inconsistencies**:
   - OpenAI tends to preserve initials as the first name but fails validation
   - Anthropic often ignores initials and treats the next word as the first name
   - This creates inconsistent behavior depending on which provider is used

3. **String Type Validation Implementation**:
   Examining the code in `src/utils/prompts/types/memorialFields.js`:
   ```javascript
   // Simplified version of current code
   MEMORIAL_FIELDS.first_name = {
     type: 'string',
     required: true,
     transform: (value) => value.trim().toUpperCase(),
     validate: (value) => /^[A-Z]+$/.test(value) // Only accepts simple uppercase names
   };
   ```
   This validation pattern is too restrictive for real-world names.

4. **Missing Name Variation Handling**:
   - No recognition of common prefixes (Rev., Dr., Mr., etc.)
   - No handling of suffixes (Jr., Sr., III, etc.)
   - No accommodation for initials with periods (e.g., "J.R.")
   - No support for culturally diverse name formats

5. **Incorrect Regular Expression Patterns**:
   - Current regex patterns like `/^[A-Z]+$/` only match continuous uppercase letters
   - This fails on names with initials, spaces, hyphens, or apostrophes
   - No accommodation for non-English characters or diacritics

### Partial Solution Implemented
The error handling aspect has been improved:
1. Validation errors are now caught and properly reported
2. Processing continues for other files even when validation errors occur
3. The error information is tracked and displayed to the user
4. Results for valid records are preserved and displayed

### Detailed Fix Proposal

1. **Update Name Validation Regular Expressions**:
   ```javascript
   // Replace current validation regex with more flexible pattern
   MEMORIAL_FIELDS.first_name = {
     type: 'string',
     required: true,
     transform: (value) => value?.trim().toUpperCase() || '',
     // New pattern accommodates initials, compound names, and single-character names
     validate: (value) => value === '' || /^[A-Z\.]{1,2}(\.[A-Z\.]{1,2})*$|^[A-Z]+([\s\-'][A-Z]+)*$/.test(value)
   };

   MEMORIAL_FIELDS.last_name = {
     type: 'string',
     required: true,
     transform: (value) => value?.trim().toUpperCase() || '',
     // Allow more complex last names with prefixes, hyphens, apostrophes
     validate: (value) => value === '' || /^[A-Z]+([\s\-'][A-Z]+)*(\s(JR|SR|I{1,3}|IV|V|VI{1,3}))?$/.test(value)
   };
   ```

2. **Implement Name Preprocessing**:
   Create a new preprocessing function to standardize names before validation:
   ```javascript
   function preprocessName(nameString) {
     if (!nameString) return { firstName: '', lastName: '' };
     
     // Remove common prefixes
     const withoutPrefix = nameString.replace(/^(REV|DR|MR|MRS|MS|MISS)\.?\s+/i, '');
     
     // Handle case with only initials and last name
     const initialsMatch = withoutPrefix.match(/^([A-Z](\.[A-Z])*\.?)\s+([A-Z][A-Za-z\s\-']+)(\s+(JR|SR|I{1,3}|IV|V|VI{1,3}))?$/);
     if (initialsMatch) {
       return {
         firstName: initialsMatch[1], // Initials become first name
         lastName: initialsMatch[3] + (initialsMatch[4] || '')
       };
     }
     
     // Handle standard case
     const parts = withoutPrefix.split(/\s+/);
     if (parts.length === 1) {
       // Single name - treat as last name
       return { firstName: '', lastName: parts[0] };
     }
     
     // Handle suffix if present
     const suffixMatch = parts[parts.length-1].match(/^(JR|SR|I{1,3}|IV|V|VI{1,3})$/i);
     if (suffixMatch && parts.length > 2) {
       // Last part is a suffix, so last name is second-to-last part + suffix
       return {
         firstName: parts.slice(0, parts.length-2).join(' '),
         lastName: parts[parts.length-2] + ' ' + parts[parts.length-1]
       };
     }
     
     // Default case: first part is first name, rest is last name
     return {
       firstName: parts[0],
       lastName: parts.slice(1).join(' ')
     };
   }
   ```

3. **Modify the MemorialOCRPrompt Class**:
   Update the validation process to use the new preprocessing function:
   ```javascript
   validateAndConvert(data) {
     // Early validation for completely empty data
     if (!data || Object.keys(data).length === 0) {
       throw new ProcessingError('No readable text found on the sheet', 'empty_sheet');
     }
     
     const result = {};
     
     // Preprocess name fields if both are present
     if (data.first_name !== undefined || data.last_name !== undefined) {
       const nameString = [data.first_name, data.last_name].filter(Boolean).join(' ');
       const { firstName, lastName } = preprocessName(nameString);
       data.first_name = firstName;
       data.last_name = lastName;
     }
     
     // Continue with existing validation...
     // ...
   }
   ```

4. **Implement Provider-Specific Name Extraction Rules**:
   Create configuration options for provider-specific name handling:
   ```javascript
   const providerNameRules = {
     openai: {
       // OpenAI tends to preserve initials
       preserveInitials: true,
       splitOnCapitals: false
     },
     anthropic: {
       // Anthropic often ignores initials
       preserveInitials: false,
       splitOnCapitals: true
     }
   };
   
   // Use these rules in the MemorialOCRPrompt class
   constructor(options = {}) {
     super();
     this.nameRules = providerNameRules[options.provider] || providerNameRules.openai;
     // ...
   }
   ```

5. **Add Comprehensive Test Cases**:
   Create tests for various name formats:
   ```javascript
   // Test cases to add:
   const nameTestCases = [
     { input: 'John Doe', expected: { first_name: 'JOHN', last_name: 'DOE' } },
     { input: 'J.R. Smith', expected: { first_name: 'J.R.', last_name: 'SMITH' } },
     { input: 'Smith', expected: { first_name: '', last_name: 'SMITH' } },
     { input: 'Rev. Peter Butler', expected: { first_name: 'PETER', last_name: 'BUTLER' } },
     { input: 'R.R Talbot Junr', expected: { first_name: 'R.R', last_name: 'TALBOT JUNR' } },
     { input: 'Mary Anne O\'Brien', expected: { first_name: 'MARY ANNE', last_name: 'O\'BRIEN' } },
     { input: 'Smith-Jones', expected: { first_name: '', last_name: 'SMITH-JONES' } }
   ];
   ```

### Remaining Work
1. ~~Implement the name validation rules and preprocessing logic~~ ✅
2. ~~Add support for handling multiple records on a single page~~ (Not required - additional names are in inscription field)
3. Standardize name parsing across providers
4. Fix the "undefined attempts" bug in the error message for validation errors

## Issue #4: Progress Bar Over-Counting with Anthropic
**Status:** Partially Resolved  
**Date Reported:** 2024-03-22  
**Component:** UI/Progress Tracking  
**Severity:** Medium  
**Related:** Issue #2  

### Description
When uploading 3 individual images using the Anthropic provider, the progress bar incorrectly counts up to 300%. This appears to be a variant of Issue #2, but with different behavior specific to the Anthropic provider.

**Update (2025-05-23):** Further testing confirms that progress bar behavior is inconsistent:
- With 3 populated images: progress reaches 200% before redirecting
- With 3 images (one empty): progress reaches 300% with no automatic redirect
- This suggests a compounding problem when empty images are involved

### Analysis
This issue, combined with Issue #2, suggests:
1. Progress tracking is not properly normalized across providers
2. Progress calculation might be:
   - Adding instead of averaging progress
   - Not accounting for provider-specific processing steps
   - Double-counting certain events
3. No upper bound validation on progress percentage
4. Provider-specific progress tracking may need different handling
5. Error handling for empty images affects progress calculation differently

### Partial Resolution
Progress tracking has been improved but not fully fixed. Implementation of error handling has resolved some aspects of this issue, but the progress calculation still doesn't handle multiple files correctly with Anthropic.

## Issue #5: Premature Redirect and Incomplete Results Display
**Status:** Intermittent  
**Date Reported:** 2025-05-22  
**Component:** Progress Tracking and Results Display  
**Severity:** Medium  
**Related:** Issues #2 and #4

### Description
When uploading multiple images (including a mix of valid and empty sheets), the system:
1. Correctly identifies empty sheets and tracks them as errors
2. Prematurely redirects to the results page after processing only some files
3. Shows incomplete results on initial page load
4. Only displays all processed results after manually refreshing the results page

**Update (2025-05-22):** Testing with a multi-page PDF showed improved behavior:
- Progress bar worked correctly, showing proper progression to 100%
- All valid results were present on the initial results page load
- Validation errors were properly handled and reported

The issue appears to be intermittent or context-dependent, possibly related to:
- Different upload methods (individual files vs. multi-page PDFs)
- Processing time differences between files
- Race conditions that occur under specific circumstances

### Reproduction Steps
1. Select 3 images for upload (1 empty sheet, 2 valid sheets)
2. Submit for processing
3. Observe progress bar reaches 100% after processing only some files
4. System redirects to results page showing only one result
5. Refreshing the page shows both valid results and the error for the empty sheet

### Expected Behavior
1. Progress bar should increment proportionally:
   - 33% after processing first file
   - 66% after processing second file
   - 100% after processing all three files
2. Redirect should only occur after all files are completely processed
3. Results page should show all processed results on initial load without requiring refresh

### Analysis
The issue stems from:
1. Possible race condition where the redirect occurs before all processing completes
2. Potential caching issue with the results endpoint
3. Progress complete flag possibly being set too early in some circumstances
4. Inconsistent state between the backend processing status and frontend progress tracking

### Proposed Solution
1. Add more robust synchronization between file processing completion and redirection
2. Implement a delay or confirmation mechanism before redirecting
3. Ensure the results endpoint always returns the most current data
4. Add additional logging to track the exact sequence of events in problematic cases
5. Implement a final verification step before marking processing as complete

## Issue #6: Source File Information Missing in View Inscription Modal
**Status:** Open  
**Date Reported:** 2025-05-23  
**Component:** UI/Results Display  
**Severity:** Medium  

### Description
When viewing memorial details in the modal dialog, the source file information (filename of the original image/PDF) is not displayed. This makes it difficult for users to trace back results to their original source documents, especially when processing multiple files in a batch.

### Expected Behavior
1. The memorial details modal should include the source filename
2. The source file information should be clearly labeled
3. For multi-page PDFs, both the original PDF name and the page number should be displayed

### Analysis
The issue appears to be that:
1. The source file information is captured during processing but not displayed in the UI
2. The memorial details modal template does not include a field for the source file
3. The data is likely available in the database but not included in the API response

### Proposed Solution
1. Update the memorial details modal template to include a source file field
2. Modify the API response to include the source file information
3. Ensure the source file is properly captured and stored during processing
4. For multi-page PDFs, extract and store both the filename and page number

## Issue #7: Modal View Button Click Not Working
**Status:** Resolved  
**Date Reported:** 2024-03-22  
**Component:** UI/Modal  
**Severity:** Medium  

### Description
When clicking the "View" button in the results table, the modal does not appear. This prevents users from viewing detailed information about processed memorials.

**Update (2024-05-25):** Issue resolved by implementing a new `MemorialModal` class with:
- Proper event handling for modal show/hide
- Loading state management
- Standardized name formatting (uppercase last names)
- Consistent date formatting
- Graceful handling of missing data
- Comprehensive test coverage
- Clear separation of concerns (UI updates, data formatting, event handling)

The implementation follows TDD principles with a full test suite covering:
- Modal initialization
- Loading states
- Content population
- Event handling
- Edge cases (missing data)

## Issue #8: Unnecessary Periods Added to Regular Names
**Status:** Resolved  
**Date Reported:** 2025-05-23  
**Component:** Name Processing  
**Severity:** Medium  

### Description
When processing certain inscriptions, the system incorrectly treats regular names as if they were initials, adding periods after each letter. For example, with an inscription reading:

```
"JAMES BURKE (of ___ DIED MAR 27 ___ SARAH ___ MAY ___"
```

The first name "JAMES" was incorrectly processed and stored as "J.A.M.E.S."

### Expected Behavior
Regular names like "JAMES" should be identified as complete names, not initials, and should not have periods added between each letter.

**Update (2025-05-24):** Issue Resolved:
- Implemented common name detection in standardized name parser
- Added test cases specifically for the JAMES case and similar scenarios
- Updated name processing logic to prevent incorrect initial formatting
- Integrated fix into `MemorialOCRPrompt.js`
- All test cases passing, including the JAMES example
- Solution maintains correct handling of actual initials while preventing false positives

The fix was implemented as part of the larger name standardization effort, which includes:
1. Common name dictionary to prevent incorrect initial formatting
2. Improved heuristics for distinguishing between initials and full names
3. Context-aware name processing
4. Comprehensive test coverage for edge cases
