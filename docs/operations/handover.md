# Text Harvester - Project Handover

## Project Overview
The Text Harvester is a web application for OCR processing of handwritten text and monument photos in the heritage sector. The application supports dual processing modes with multiple AI providers and comprehensive results management.

## Current State
- **Main Branch**: `main` (production-ready)
- **Latest Features**: Monument Photo OCR, Model Selection, Enhanced Results
- **Documentation**: Complete in `/docs/` directory
- **Status**: Production-ready with full feature set

## Completed Features

### **Monument Photo OCR** ✅
- Dual processing modes (Record Sheet + Monument Photo)
- Genealogical transcription standards with dash notation
- EXIF orientation correction for monument photos
- Intelligent image optimization for different AI providers
- Source type tracking and display

### **Model Selection** ✅
- Multiple AI providers (OpenAI GPT-4o, Anthropic Claude 4 Sonnet)
- Model-specific optimization and processing
- Provider-specific prompts and error handling
- Model information tracking and display

### **Enhanced Results** ✅
- Sortable results table with expandable rows
- Source type badges and filtering
- Comprehensive export functionality (CSV/JSON)
- Real-time processing updates and progress tracking

### **Technical Infrastructure** ✅
- Complete database schema with source_type support
- Robust error handling and validation
- Performance monitoring and alerting
- Comprehensive test coverage

## Next Steps: Bug Hunt

### Frontend Priority Areas
1. UI Responsiveness
   - Test across different devices and screen sizes
   - Focus on model selection dropdown behavior
   - Check loading states and transitions

2. Browser Compatibility
   - Test in Chrome, Firefox, Safari
   - Verify model selection works across browsers
   - Check export functionality

3. Accessibility
   - Test with screen readers
   - Verify ARIA attributes
   - Check color contrast for model badges

### Backend Priority Areas
1. Concurrent Processing
   - Stress test with multiple simultaneous uploads
   - Monitor memory usage
   - Verify queue behavior

2. Error Handling
   - Test rate limiting scenarios
   - Verify error message propagation
   - Check database connection stability

3. Data Validation
   - Test boundary cases for input
   - Verify model parameter validation
   - Check export data integrity

## Key Files to Review
- `public/js/modules/results/main.js` - Results page logic
- `src/utils/dataConversion.js` - Data processing utilities
- `public/results.html` - Results page template
- `public/css/styles.css` - Styling including model badges
- `jest.config.js` - Test configuration

## Environment Setup
1. Clone the repository
2. Switch to `feature/model-selection` branch
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Run database migrations
5. Configure API keys for both OpenAI and Anthropic

## Testing
