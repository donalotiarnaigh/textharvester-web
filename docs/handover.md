# Text Harvester - Model Selection Feature Handover

## Project Overview
The Text Harvester web application is being enhanced with a model selection feature that allows users to choose between OpenAI and Anthropic models for text processing. The feature is currently implemented and ready for bug hunting phase.

## Current State
- Branch: `feature/model-selection`
- Latest Commit: Implementation of model selection feature and test suite
- WBS Location: `docs/features/model-selection-wbs.md`

## Completed Features

### Frontend
- Model selection dropdown on upload page
- Processing page with model-specific status messages
- Results page with model information display
- CSV/JSON export functionality including model data
- Responsive UI with model badges (OpenAI: blue, Anthropic: info)

### Backend
- Database migration for model tracking (ai_provider, model_version columns)
- Updated upload endpoint with model parameter support
- Enhanced processing pipeline for multiple models
- Error handling and rollback capabilities

### Testing
- Unit tests for model selection functionality
- Integration tests for end-to-end flows
- New test suites in `__tests__/ui/` and `__tests__/utils/`

## Next Steps: Bug Hunt

### Frontend Priority Areas
1. UI Responsiveness
   - Test across different devices and screen sizes
   - Focus on model selection dropdown behavior
   - Check loading states and transitions

2. Browser Compatibility
   - Test in Chrome, Firefox, Safari
   - Verify model selection works across browsers
   - Check export functionality

3. Accessibility
   - Test with screen readers
   - Verify ARIA attributes
   - Check color contrast for model badges

### Backend Priority Areas
1. Concurrent Processing
   - Stress test with multiple simultaneous uploads
   - Monitor memory usage
   - Verify queue behavior

2. Error Handling
