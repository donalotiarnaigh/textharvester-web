## Summary Analysis

### Common OCR Errors in Mistral

Across all files, Mistral OCR showed these patterns:

1. **Letter substitution errors**:
   - "SESUS" instead of "JESUS"
   - "SUN" instead of "SIN"
   - "BO." instead of "NO."
   - "DURIED" instead of "BURIED"
   - "WEED BY" instead of "OWNED BY"
   - "EARIAL" instead of "BURIAL"

2. **Number errors**:
   - "82 HEADSTONES" instead of "2 HEADSTONES"

3. **Name errors**:
   - "SEANNIE" instead of "JEANNIE"
   - "MADGE" instead of "WADGE"

### GPT-5.1 Advantages

1. **Error correction**: Automatically corrects OCR errors using context
2. **Structured extraction**: Organizes data into meaningful fields
3. **Semantic understanding**: Identifies relationships (e.g., wife of, daughter of)
4. **Date normalization**: Converts dates to ISO format
5. **Data validation**: Ensures consistency across fields

### Conclusion

- **Mistral OCR**: Good for raw text extraction, but requires post-processing
- **GPT-5.1**: Combines OCR + error correction + structuring in one step
- **Recommendation**: For grave cards, GPT-5.1 provides significantly better results despite higher cost
