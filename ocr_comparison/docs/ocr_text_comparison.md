## Key Observations

### OCR Errors in Mistral
- "BO. BURIED" instead of "NO. BURIED"
- "SESUS" instead of "JESUS" (appears twice)
- "SUN" instead of "SIN"
- "82 HEADSTONES" instead of "2 HEADSTONES"

### GPT-5.1 Corrections
- Correctly identified "JESUS" despite OCR showing "SESUS"
- Correctly identified "SIN" despite OCR showing "SUN"
- Correctly identified "2 HEADSTONES" despite OCR showing "82"
- Properly structured names, dates, and relationships

### Conclusion
- **Mistral**: Provides raw OCR with some errors typical of OCR systems
- **GPT-5.1**: Not only extracts text but also corrects OCR errors through contextual understanding
- **Winner for accuracy**: GPT-5.1 (combines OCR + error correction + structuring)
